# exponential-tax

Clojure code designed to compute values for exponential land tax

## Usage 

    (use 'exponential-tax.core)
    (sample-taxes 0.5 1.05 holding-sizes)

Where:

* 0.5 is the *constant*
* 1.05 is the *exponent*
* holding sizes is a list of lists formatted thus:

	(def holding-sizes
	  [["Average croft" 5]
	   ["Average farm" 101]
	   ["Glasgow Airport" 300]
	   ["Edinburgh Airport" 400]
	   ["Grangemouth Refinery" 700]
	   ["Thousand hectares" 1000]
	   ["Ten thousand hectares" 10000]
	   ["Countess of Sutherland" 33000]
	   ["Earl of Seafield" 40000]
	   ["Captain Alwynn Farquharson" 51800]
	   ["Duke of Westminster" 54000]
	   ["Duke of Atholl" 58700]
	   ["Duke of Buccleuch" 109000]])

## Discussion

Exponential land tax is an idea for a tax which would have the effect of breaking up large estates.

The core of the idea is that you pay a small amount on your first hectare of land, a little bit more on your next hectare, a little bit more on your next, and so on. There are two key numbers in this idea: the constant, which is the amount of money you pay on the first hectare, and the exponent, which is the power the number of hectares we've counted so far is raised to to calculate the little bit more.
